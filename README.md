# TÃ¼Reuth Legal at SemEval Task 6 Code

This repository contains the code to replicate experiments for our participation at SemEval Task 6: LegalAI.
Note that we only participate in subtask (A), predicting Rhetiorical Roles.

## Usage
  1. Create Folder `data`
  2. Place 3 `json` files called `train.json`, `dev.json`, and `test.json` in folder `data`. These files are provided by the shared task organisers, but have to be renamed accordingly
  3. Run `python main.py`. This will train and safe all models and output test predictions in file `test_predictions.pickle`.

Note that training MLPs and fine-tuning LMs requires GPU and internet access to download models from huggingface model hub.

## Requirements
  * `torch` (with GPU support)
  * `transformers`
  * `datasets`
  * `nltk`
  * `numpy`
  * `scipy`
  * `pandas`
  * `tqdm`
